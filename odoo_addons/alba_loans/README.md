## Overview

`alba_loans` is the core lending engine for Alba Capital's Odoo Enterprise instance.
It manages the full loan lifecycle — from customer KYC and 9-stage application
workflow through disbursement, repayment scheduling, accounting automation, and
portfolio risk monitoring.

It also provides **native M-Pesa Daraja API integration** (STK Push, C2B Paybill/Till,
B2C payouts) with a full transaction audit log and automated reconciliation.

## M-Pesa Integration

### Overview

The M-Pesa integration uses the [Safaricom Daraja API v1](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/Documentation).
It supports three transaction flows:

| Flow | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **STK Push** (Lipa Na M-Pesa Online) | Outbound → Customer | Request payment from customer's handset |
| **C2B** (Customer to Business) | Inbound ← Safaricom | Receive Paybill / Till payments automatically |
| **B2C** (Business to Customer) | Outbound → Customer | Investor payouts / refunds |

### Configuration

1. In Odoo, go to **Alba Loans → M-Pesa → M-Pesa Configuration**.
2. Create a new configuration record:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Environment** | `Sandbox` for testing, `Production` for live |
| **Consumer Key** | From [Daraja portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke) |
| **Consumer Secret** | From Daraja portal |
| **Business Short Code** | Your Paybill number (e.g. `174379` for sandbox) |
| **Till Number** | Optional — only for Buy Goods transactions |
| **Passkey** | Lipa Na M-Pesa passkey (required for STK Push) |
| **Callback Base URL** | Public HTTPS URL of this Odoo instance |

3. Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials.
4. Click **Register C2B URLs** to push the validation and confirmation callback
   URLs to Safaricom.

### Callback Endpoints

These are automatically computed from **Callback Base URL**:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /alba/mpesa/stk/callback` | STK Push result |
| `POST /alba/mpesa/c2b/validation` | C2B payment validation |
| `POST /alba/mpesa/c2b/confirmation` | C2B payment confirmation |
| `POST /alba/mpesa/b2c/result` | B2C payout result |
| `POST /alba/mpesa/b2c/timeout` | B2C queue timeout |
| `GET  /alba/mpesa/health` | Liveness probe |

Register `/alba/mpesa/stk/callback`, `/alba/mpesa/b2c/result`, and
`/alba/mpesa/b2c/timeout` manually in the [Daraja portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke).

### STK Push Flow

1. Open a loan in **Alba Loans → Loans → Active Loans**.
2. Click **Request M-Pesa Payment** (visible on the loan form header).
3. The wizard pre-fills the customer's phone, the next instalment amount,
   and the loan number as account reference.
4. Click **Send STK Push**.
5. The customer receives a payment prompt on their phone.
6. Safaricom fires a callback to `/alba/mpesa/stk/callback`.
7. The `alba.mpesa.transaction` record is updated automatically.
8. A pending **Retry cron** (every 30 min) re-queries any transactions
   that have not received a callback.

### C2B Payment Flow

When a customer pays to the Paybill / Till directly:

1. Safaricom calls `/alba/mpesa/c2b/validation` — the handler checks that
   the `BillRefNumber` (loan number) exists and is an active loan.
2. Safaricom calls `/alba/mpesa/c2b/confirmation` — an `alba.mpesa.transaction`
   record is created and auto-matched to the loan.
3. The **hourly auto-reconcile cron** creates a draft `alba.loan.repayment`
   for every completed, unreconciled transaction with a matched loan.
4. An officer opens the draft repayment, reviews the allocation, and clicks **Post**.

### Transaction Reconciliation

Go to **Alba Loans → M-Pesa → Needs Attention** to see all completed transactions
that have not been reconciled to a repayment.

- **Auto-Match Loan** — match by account reference (loan number).
- **Reconcile to Loan** — create a draft repayment.
- **Query Status** — re-query Safaricom for pending STK transactions.

### Sandbox Testing

Use the [Daraja sandbox](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/test_credentials):

| Setting | Sandbox Value |
|---------|--------------|
| Short Code | `174379` |
| Passkey | `bfb279f9aa9bdbcf158e97dd71a467cd2e0c893059b10f78e6b72ada1ed2c919` |
| Test MSISDN | `254708374149` |
| Consumer Key | From your sandbox app on the Daraja portal |

## Automation & Cron Jobs

Eight scheduled actions are installed with the module:

| Job | Schedule | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Update PAR Buckets** | Daily | Recompute days_in_arrears / par_bucket for all active loans |
| **NPL Monitor** | Daily | Flag loans with ≥ 90 days arrears as Non-Performing |
| **Overdue Payment Alerts** | Daily | Post chatter alerts at 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days overdue |
| **Maturity Date Reminders** | Weekly | Alert officers for loans maturing within 30 days |
| **Auto-close Repaid Loans** | Daily | Close loans with outstanding_balance ≤ 0 |
| **Query Pending STK** | Every 30 min | Re-query Safaricom for unresolved STK transactions |
| **Auto-reconcile M-Pesa** | Hourly | Match completed transactions to loans and create draft repayments |
| **Push Portfolio Stats** | Every 6 hours | Send aggregate PAR / NPL metrics to Django via webhook |

All crons are installed with `noupdate="1"` so they can be adjusted per
deployment without being overwritten on module upgrade.

Configure the NPL threshold (default 90 days):

```
Settings → Technical → System Parameters → alba.loans.npl_threshold_days
```

## Security Groups

| Group | Technical ID | Permissions |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Loan User** | `alba_loans.group_loan_user` | Read-only on customers, applications, loans, repayments |
| **Loan Officer** | `alba_loans.group_loan_officer` | Full create/edit; can post repayments; access M-Pesa transactions |
| **Loan Manager** | `alba_loans.group_loan_manager` | All of the above + delete + product/M-Pesa config management + reversal |

## API / Webhook Events Fired

This module fires the following webhook events to the Django portal
(via `alba_integration`):

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `loan.disbursed` | Loan disbursement wizard completed |
| `loan.npl_flagged` | Daily NPL monitor cron flags loans ≥ 90 days arrears |
| `loan.closed` | Auto-close cron closes fully-repaid loans |
| `loan.instalment_overdue` | Daily overdue alert cron (at 1/3/7/14/30 days) |
| `loan.maturing_soon` | Weekly maturity reminder cron |
| `payment.matched` | Repayment posted and accounting entry created |
| `payment.mpesa_received` | C2B confirmation or STK callback received |
| `portfolio.stats_updated` | Every-6-hours portfolio stats cron |

All events are signed with HMAC-SHA256 and include a `delivery_id` UUID for
idempotency on the Django side.

---

## Related Module — `alba_sms`

The `alba_sms` module extends `alba_loans` via `_inherit` to add outbound SMS
notifications.  It hooks into the following methods without modifying this
module's code:

| Hook point | SMS event |
|---|---|
| `cron_send_overdue_alerts()` | Overdue reminder SMS per customer (1/3/7/14/30-day buckets) |
| `cron_send_maturity_reminders()` | Maturity notice SMS per maturing loan |
| `action_send_collection_reminder()` | **Uses the existing `sms_template` field** on `alba.loan.collection.stage` — this field was defined here but never called until `alba_sms` was installed |
| `alba.loan.repayment.action_post()` | Payment confirmation SMS |

> **Dual-notification note:** `alba_integration` fires `loan.instalment_overdue`
> and `loan.maturing_soon` webhooks to Django on the same cron runs that
> `alba_sms` fires SMS.  If the Django portal also sends SMS on those webhook
> events, customers will receive duplicate messages.  Coordinate with the Django
> webhook handler to prevent this.

The `sms_template` field on `alba.loan.collection.stage` accepts free-text with
`{placeholder}` substitution.  Available tokens: `{customer_name}`,
`{loan_number}`, `{amount}`, `{days}`, `{company_name}`.
Default values are seeded when `alba_loans` is installed.
